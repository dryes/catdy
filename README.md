catdy
=====

catdy is for determining categories of given warez scene directories or dirnames.

* intended for sorting mixed-up/misplaced releases.
* entirely self-contained - zero dependence on external resources.
* contains a large selection of categories - both old and new.
* like FOXDIE but for cats.

## dependencies:
* Python2

## usage:
* catdy.py [--opts] input1 [input2] ...

## notes:
* does not move anything itself - but aims to be easily integratable with other commands/scripts.
* use `-c` to print category only.
* works best when directory contents are original and not unpacked.
* something like this is never going to be 100% accurate - don't expect it to be.
